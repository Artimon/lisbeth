/******************************************************************
 * Lisbeth - High performance simple data access layer.
 *****************************************************************/


## What is Lisbeth? ##
Lisbeth provides classes for MySQL database access via entities and
entity collections, using automated caching for high performance.


## What are the requirements? ##
To use Lisbeth you have to install the PHP memcache extension.


## What are the advantages of Lisbeth? ##
The main advantages are performance and super easy usability.


## What does Lisbeth cover? ##
The Lisbeth entity-collection-model is, by intention, designed to
support database designs, where entities are referenced via integer
primary keys and collections are referenced via integer indices.

The classes support any kind of query and caching, but the core
entity-collection-model is optimized for the 99% of queries which
work that way.


## Who is using Lisbeth?
Lisbeth arose from the browsergame "Schlacht um Kyoto"
(engl.: "Battle for Kyoto") at http://www.schlacht-um-kyoto.de in order
to improve performance with a data structure that should work as simple
as possible with automated caching.


## What is the development state? ##
Currently the system is not fully re-integrated into the browsergame
that introduced the basic structures of Lisbeth, thus it may be not
100% stable yet.


## What kind of name is this? ##
Actually this is a nickname of a virtual roleplay character of mine.
